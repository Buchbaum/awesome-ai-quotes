<strong id="john-mccarthy">John McCarthy</strong>
>“Our ultimate objective is to make programs that learn from their experience as effectively as humans do. We shall…say that a program has common sense if it automatically deduces for itself a sufficiently wide class of immediate consequences of anything it is told and what it already knows.”

<strong id="mark-cuban">Mark Cuban</strong>

>“Within a few decades, machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to The Singularity — technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history.”

<strong id="stephen-hawking">Stephen Hawking</strong>
>“Success in creating effective AI, could be the biggest event in the history of our civilization. Or the worst. We just don’t know. So, we cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI, or ignored by it and side-lined, or conceivably destroyed by it.”

<strong id="stuart-russel">Stuart Russell</strong>
>“No one has a clue how to build a conscious machine, at all.”

<strong id="terry-pratchett">[Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett)</strong> — humorist, satirist, and author of fantasy novels, especially comical works.
